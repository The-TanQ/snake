Control the Snake: Use the arrow keys on your keyboard to control the movement of the snake. The snake will continuously move in the direction of the last arrow key pressed.

Eat the Food: Guide the snake to eat the food (represented by a red dot) that appears randomly on the screen. Each time the snake eats food, it will grow longer.
